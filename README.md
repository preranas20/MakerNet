# MakerNet



## Usage
Social Web Application developed to connect Makers of Makerspace to the world. The makers can share what they have developed/created, make their personlized About Me Page, share their views with other makers increasing the social interactions.This application creates a forum for creative exchange and learning. It consists of potential re-usability of reusable raw materials from the makers and bridges the gap between the raw material used and wasted as part of the production by one maker to be mapped by a potential user.
